## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/vocascan/vocascan-server/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 2021.11.20

After some time, the new version of Vocascan Server has finally been released, with import/export features to share your
vocabulary packages. The new invitation codes will help you to keep your server all to yourself and your friends. We've
included major structural changes, working on a completely new configuration and starting option to make setup even
easier. Therefore we now publish the new CLI as a npm package to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vocascan/server)
and the [GitHub Package Registry](https://github.com/vocascan/vocascan-server/packages/1077993). Additionally, there is
now a fully functional and configurable logger. To find out more, it's best to check out our
[documentation](https://docs.vocascan.com/#/vocascan-server/installation). Recently, there are templates for starting
with PM2, Docker or Traefik, which should provide flexibility.

!> Last but not least, we have adjusted the names of the packages. These are now only accessible under
`vocascan/server`, no longer via `vocascan/vocascan-server`.

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/vocascan/vocascan-server/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2021.06.13

Finally the time has come. The first release of Vocascan is ready. Vocascan is a server-client vocabulary trainer that
is intended to give the user many setting options so that he can adapt it to his personal learning strategies and
habits. All the basic functions of a vocabulary trainer are currently built in, making it fully functional. However,
there are still many more features to come. Due to the data protection guidelines, we cannot yet provide a public
server, which means that you currently have to host it yourself. But we are working as quickly as possible to use the
trainer offline.

- Basic functions
  - Register/Login
  - Change password function
  - Delete user account function
  - Add/modify/delete packages
  - Add/modify/delete groups
  - Add/modify/delete vocabs
  - Get query vocabs
  - Check answer
  - Stats counter for each day
